              <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
              <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of 
                  reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of 
                  different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to 
                  the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.
                	Variable </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href= "url"> Variable Declaration </a>	Variable Declaration JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, 
                        a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span1 style>var x</span1>;
                        </li>
                    <li><a href="url">Variable Assignment </a>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it,
                                         giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span1 >var x = 10</span1> ;</li>    
                    <li><a href="url">	DatAilyws</a>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span1>true</span1> or<span1>false</span1>; null -<span1>null</span1>  aka 
                                        nothing; Number - <span1>42</span1> or <span1>3.14159</span1>; String - <span1>"Coding Dojo Rocks!"</span1>; Array -	<span1>'Coding'. 2. 'Dojo!)</span1>: and Object -<span1> {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe!}</span1></li> 
                    <li><a href="url">	Conditionals</a>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your 
                                        code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements:<span1> if </span1>a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span1>else if </span1> it to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span1>else</span1> we execute this block of code;</li> 
                    <li><a href="url">Loops</a>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.
                                         Thats a loop!</li> 
                    <li><a href="url">Bawl:ion </a>Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started,
                                         first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
